# Second Brain Vault

This vault is the default KoroMind-ready knowledge workspace.

## Purpose
- Capture quickly without losing context.
- Keep notes searchable through predictable filenames and indexes.
- Preserve durable knowledge separately from day-to-day thinking.

## Canonical Entry Points
- `AGENTS.md` - agent operating rules and schema.
- `notes/_INDEX.md` - map of working notes.
- `knowledge/_INDEX.md` - map of evergreen references.
- `projects/_INDEX.md` - map of active project workspaces.
- `inbox/quick-notes.md` - primary rapid capture file.

## Triage Workflow
1. Capture in `inbox/quick-notes.md`.
2. Move items into `notes/`, `knowledge/`, or `projects/`.
3. Add links in the nearest `_INDEX.md`.
4. Add backlinks to related topics and people.

## Naming Rules
- Daily notes: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- Source notes: `YYYY-MM-DD_topic.md`.
- Meetings: `YYYY-MM-DD_person-topic.md`.
- Topic and people pages: lowercase kebab-case.

## Maintenance Cadence
- Daily: clear inbox and write/update the daily note.
- Weekly: refresh `_INDEX.md` files and remove stale placeholders.
- Monthly: promote recurring patterns into `knowledge/`.
