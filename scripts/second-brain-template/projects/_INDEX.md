## Project Onboarding Rule
For each new project folder:
1. Create `AGENTS.md` with local operating rules.
2. Create `README.md` with scope, goals, and key links.
3. Link the project here.

## Maintenance
- Keep active projects at the top.
- Mark archived projects in-place instead of deleting history.
