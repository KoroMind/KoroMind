# Project Agent Rules

Use this folder for repository-specific decisions, implementation notes, and operational context.

## Required Files
- `README.md` - scope, goals, key links.
- `decisions.md` - ADR-style decisions with dates.
- `roadmap.md` - short-term milestones.

## Local Conventions
- Link important notes from this project's README.
- Keep decision records append-only and dated.
