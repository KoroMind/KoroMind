# Project Agent Rules

Use this folder for non-code or hybrid project context.

## Required Files
- `README.md` - objective, constraints, references.
- `notes.md` - ongoing working notes.
- `timeline.md` - milestones and checkpoints.

## Local Conventions
- Keep milestones dated.
- Record assumptions and unresolved questions explicitly.
